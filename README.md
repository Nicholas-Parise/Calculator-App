On startup the calculator is in “<b>BAS</b>” or basic mode. Clicking on “<b>BAS</b>” will change the mode to
“<b>ADV</b>” or advanced. This works in the opposite way as well. <br>
Entering the sequence: on basic mode: <br>
10 <br>
+5* <br>
-> 15 <br>
2 <br>
= 30 <br>
Entering the sequence: on advanced mode: <br>
10+5*2 = 20 <br>
Entering the sequence: on basic and advanced mode <br>
10/0 = Error <br>
Entering the sequence: in advanced mode <br>
10**6 = Error (as there are to many operators) <br>
Entering the sequence: in advanced mode <br>
5-(6+(5) = Error (as there are too many open brackets) <br>
